# GetSites

Gets possible sites for the specific appointment type. A site is a geographically-unique place. Each site may include additional 'locations', which are typically rooms at the site (Room 123, Surgery, etc.), but may also be geographically different places associated with the site (First floor, West wing, Building 3, etc.).

The API will only present you with locations which mean something to a user. So they're unlikely to get a choice about Room 1, 2, 3, etc. but they may get a choice about Site: My Bank, Location: Floor 1, Floor 50, Floor 100, etc.
