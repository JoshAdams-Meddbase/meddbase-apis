# LostWork

A small object used in the [AbsenceData](../objects-and-data-types/absencedata) and [AbsenceOverview](../objects-and-data-types/absenceoverviewdata) to encapsulate the number of hours and days lost due to the patientâ€™s absence. The **Hours** and **Days** in the object are separate, in that they do not mean that _the patient was absent for four days and 32 hours_, they mean that _the patient was absent for four days, which is equivalent to 32 hours_.
